# ScanMeCalculator

Image to text app with calculator for simple arithmetic statement. This app allows the user to capture arithmetic expressions (i.e. `1+2`) either directly from
the built-in camera or from an image file picked by the user from the gallery. This project supports multiple product flavors.

- As I mentioned, it supports multiple product flavors. Main and Result Screen represent variant with Green Theme, while Camera Screen and Main Screen with Image picker represent variant with Red Theme.
- Access image to Camera or Image Picker is controlled by product flavors.
- Main Screen shows history of arithmetic expression result, user can choose either local database or file with encryption as storage of history.
- When user chooses "use storage" to "File", history will be stored with encryption operation.

## üìê Architecture and Design Principles

This app adopts [MVVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93viewmodel) with [Unidirectional flow (UDF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unidirectional_Data_Flow_(computer_science)) pattern. It follows [S.O.L.I.D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) and [The Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) to achieve maintainable, scalable and testable code base. Also the code base has been structured in multi-module project.
Thanks to [this architecture-template repository](https://github.com/android/architecture-templates) because initiation of this project used that template.

## üç¶ Product Flavors

This project has two flavor dimensions: `theme`, `mode`.
`theme` has two variants: `red` and `green`.
`mode` represents image access method: `camera` and `filesystem`.
Altogether it is possible to build 4 apks / variants:
1. app-red-filesystem
2. app-red-camera
3. app-green-filesystem
4. app-green-camera
